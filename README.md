# Telegram Bot
## What will this bot do ?

I want to add simple commands to this bot, just to play around with the Telegram Bot API a little bit.

I first want a /eat command that returns a randmon meal type, either from a database or from a list in the code.

I surely will do this with a list stored in a database so that I can build a dashboard to manage the bot.

## How will I create this ?

I want to create it manually, just to understand how it really works, I know there's a lot of libraries out there that helps with Telegram Bot creation but I wanna do this all manually.

I'm gonna be building an ExpressJS API to listen to the messages sent to the bot and respond accordingly.

This will not only help me understand how the Telegram Bot API works but also try some things with Express that I didn't do for my personnal website and will maybe never do.

## When will it be done ?

Maybe one day... hopefully ðŸ˜œ

I won't be here alot for the next 10 months so I won't have a lot of time to work on this and I will surely be working more on my personnal website than on this bot.

I will work on this bot when I need to make a pause from my personnal website.

## Request command

To help learn more about **ExpressJS**, **Telegram Bot API** and **Javascript**, you can ask me to add a command to this bot if you want to use it to.

I'll do my best to implement it and make it work.

If you want a command, just open an Issue and I'll take a look at it.

## Available Commands List

This seciton is empty for now, I'm currently figuring out how I'll do this.
